For every project you must begin by setting up a virtual environment

For this project we have been allowed to use any framework, and I used flask.

I started by pip install flask and then created an file that contains:

Creation of the product and its field,the endpoints and the  messages that will show the successs of the requests

and responses

Create a client file to test that you can actually post and get from the product resource, use dummy data and retrieve it 

Resources that can be used to test the data are postman and python script

I used python script and got a 200 and 201 message showing successful creation and retrieval of the fields for the product
